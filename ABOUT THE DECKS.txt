I'll be creating starter decks with pre chosen cards
if you have a suggestion leave it here...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

My idea is: the player has a start deck with pre chosen cards and then during gameplay he
can gain points, gold, mana whatever and exchange them for new cards.

what do you Think?
